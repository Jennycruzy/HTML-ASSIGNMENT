        <p class="biography">I am Chukwu Treasure, a graduate of Biomedical Technology, University of PortHarcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. I came across AltSchool
          Africa on Twitter in the course of my quest for knowledge of cryptocurrency and advancing technology in software engineering. Having first discovered crypto, I can visualize the financial freedom that rewards dedicationandactive participation, although this has been just some months ago after my graduation fromtheuniversity. I am at the onboarding process but being a fast learner I understand many aspectsand actively engage in them hoping to be better. In the search for more knowledge ontech, I
          discovered Altschool Africa, an academy dedicated to empower tech lovers with all the required knowledge of tech courses and shape them into practicing based on field studied</p>

        <h3>Why I Joined AltSchool</h3>
        <p class="goals">AltSchool provides a structured and immersive learning environment, which I believe is essential for mastering engineering principles. Impartation of knowledge is a special skill needed in software engineering and Altschool instructors possess the characteristics required in imparting knowledge to students and ensure everyone is carried along and comprehend the lectures adequately. Also, assignments and recommendations are given to students to enable them advance in their coding skills. However,  I joined ALtschool to enhance my coding skills and become industry-ready.</p>
